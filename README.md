*Team Members: Aravindh Gowtham Bommisetty, Krishna Mallik, Shiva Keerthan Jalla, Koushik Billakanti*

- The notebook named `Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction.ipynb` contains the full version of our code. Running the cells in order will do all the operations we did that were presented in our final presentation and report.

- Considering the size of data and model, it is suggested to use high-RAM with GPU runtime in Google Colab.
